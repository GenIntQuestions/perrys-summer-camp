###   Develop a scalable API to be able to handle the many messages this company is going to handle

* The application must be able to create and get users.
	* We do not expect you do handle any kind of authentication for users.
* The application must allow users to send a message to one other user.
	* No need to consider group chats.
* The application must allow editing and deleting messages.
* The application must be able to get all the messages sent between two users.

* The application must be able to get a list of other users that have sent or received messages to/from a specified user.

#### Technical requirements:

* The application should be a REST API (No need for any kind of UI)
* Use what language you are comfortable with, but Typescript, Javascript, Java preferred.
* The source code must be shared in a public repository (Github, Bitbucket, etc).
* The application should be ready to run in the cloud or in a container (You can use any technology available in AWS).
* The application data must be persisted in a database of some type.
